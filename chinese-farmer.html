 <h2>The story</h2>

 <blockquote https://wellsbaum.blog/alan-watts-story-of-the-chinese-farmer>

        <p>Once upon a time there was a Chinese farmer whose horse ran away. That evening, all of his neighbors came around to commiserate. They said, <q id="vl">We are so sorry to hear your horse has run away. This is most unfortunate.</q> The farmer said, <q id="farmer"><em>Maybe.</em></q> 
        <p>The next day the horse came back bringing seven wild horses with it, and in the evening everybody came back and said, <q id="vl">Oh, isn’t that lucky. What a great turn of events. You now have eight horses!</q>The farmer again said,<q id="farmer"><em>Maybe.</em></q></p>

        <p>The following day his son tried to break one of the horses, and while riding it, he was thrown and broke his leg. The neighbors then said, <q id="vl">Oh dear, that’s too <i class="bad">bad</i>,</q> and the farmer responded,<q id="farmer"><em>Maybe.</em></q> 
        <p>The next day the conscription officers came around to conscript people into the army, and they rejected his son because he had a broken leg. Again all the neighbors came around and said, <q id="vl">Isn’t that great!</q> Again, he said,<q id="farmer"><em>Maybe.</em></q></p>

        <p>The whole process of nature is an integrated process of immense complexity, and it’s really impossible to tell whether anything that happens in it is <i class="good">good</i> or <i class="bad">bad</i> — because you never know what will be the consequence of the misfortune; or, you never know what will be the consequences of good fortune.</p>

 <h3>Conclusion</h3>
        <p><i class="good">Good</i> and <i class="bad">Bad</i> are just one perspective. Bananas are good for monkeys, but monkeys are not good for bananas. Let's not make a big deal out of it...</p>
